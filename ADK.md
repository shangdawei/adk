# Android Developer Kit #
[ADK](ADK.md) is essentially the Swiss Army Knife for Android developers. [ADK](ADK.md) offers a single jar file which can be integrated into any Android project to host an arsenal of extra features. These features gives a developer more time to worry about their own projects than the tedious tasks of adding extra functions that aren't included in Android by default. ADK complements the Android SDK and brings simple functionality that any developer, beginner or expert, can add to their project and have a working system right away. ADK Service is hosted on Google App Engine to ensure uptime and compatibility with Android. There are lots of new features we plan to add such as a customer support system.

Features include (or will include):
  * Update checking
  * Changelog
  * Mandatory updates
  * Graceful global crash handling
  * Crash reporting
  * Sideload detection
  * User banning
  * 3rd party license verification

## Requirements ##
We currently support API Level 4 or greater, however your target SDK must be at least 11.
